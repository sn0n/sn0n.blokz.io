Original Hipster, mainly because my parents could afford or refused to buy me new clothes. I was born in 1980, a time between times, Not a Gen-Xer, Nor a Millenial or part of Gen-Y really... a Xennial or something, I think that's what they are calling us these days. Started playing with computers arund 1990, before that I was taking apart every electronic thing I could get my hands on, playing NES, or dorking around playing chess with various family members. Once I discovered computers it was pretty much a wrap on social life... Then in 1993 Magic: The Gathering came around,... more words later.. I'm tired. ^>^ "
