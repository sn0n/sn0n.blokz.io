### Learn With Me
website: [sn0n.github.io/learnwithme/](https://sn0n.github.io/learnwithme/)\
A simple webapp to Learn sightwords, numbers and letters. Currently you can click the words to have it spoken with a next button. Keeping the app as simple and uncluttered as possible for easy non distracted learning. Will eventually add seizure inducing flashy things that kids love to bombard their little brains with. 
Will be adding more features to this, shapes, colors and more.

### personal.community
website: [personal.community](https://personal.community)\
my hive baby,  is a social media frontend for the $hive blockchain. static site build in mostly vanilla js, keeping libraries to a minimal is a goal... lots of work to do and such, but its a fully functional hive frontend (make sure to use [hive keychain](https://hive-keychain.com/) for the best experience.)

### self-help.dev
website: [self-help.dev/](https://self-help.dev/)\
a self-help / personal development plan siteI started some years ago and never fully fleshed out. has the start of something, some templating, and a lot of incomplete. The plan is to have 2 week long skillbooks, focusing on a specific skill or project. the first 2 weeks is guided, then you'd have a webapp and/or printable pdf (as well as probably some amazon kdp paperback) to use as a guide on the journey. will be free with no ads, maybe some affiliate / referral type links, but nothing advertisy.

# others

A couple other 'someday' projects would be like, [self-hosted.info](https://self-hosted.info), eventually will have a bunch of resources for setting up a homelab for projects or even things like setting up nextcloud and other servers using as little as a spare computer up to setting up a rack.



Whatever experimental js I'm playing with can be found in the <a href='../playground/'>../playground</a> area. 
Currently tinkering with encryption things.. ish... more on that later, if my idea there goes anywhere. https://www.eff.org/dice && 
https://github.com/mervick/aes-everywhere/tree/master/javascript are two libraries I'm interested in there.... I'm sure i'll be adding more later.
