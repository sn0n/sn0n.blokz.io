<a href='https://blokz.io'>https://blokz.io</a> is my main project, which has many projects of its own... read more of an overview for blokz on the <a href="https://wiki.blokz.io">blokz wiki</a>.



experiments can be found in the <a href='../playground/'>../playground</a> area. Currently tinkering with encryption things... more on that later, if my idea there goes anywhere. https://www.eff.org/dice && 
https://github.com/mervick/aes-everywhere/tree/master/javascript are two libraries I'm interested in there.... I'm sure i'll be adding more later.
