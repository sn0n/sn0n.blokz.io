# Projects

<a href='https://blokz.io'>https://blokz.io</a> is my main project, which has its own set of sub-projects, cuz its a startup and such,... kek</a>.

Whatever experimental js I'm playing with can be found in the <a href='../playground/'>../playground</a> area. 
Currently tinkering with encryption things.. ish... more on that later, if my idea there goes anywhere. https://www.eff.org/dice && 
https://github.com/mervick/aes-everywhere/tree/master/javascript are two libraries I'm interested in there.... I'm sure i'll be adding more later.
